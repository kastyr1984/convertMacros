# Macro Conversion for NOX and MEmu

convertMacros.py -> Used to convert a file between MEmu or NOX. You could also technically use to trim unneccessary entries from your existing macros.

mergeMacros.py -> Use to merge one or more macros into an input file. Additional files are merged sequentially. You can provide a line to start merging in the input file at. This tool is primarily useful because it automatically handles time values.
